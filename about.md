title: Who the hell am I?

>Hey, I'm [@wudangt](https://github.com/wudangt), **a full-stack developer**, **entrepreneur**, and **designer**. I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D at a university.

I like representation learning, generative modeling, and deep learning. I am also interested in using information-theoretic approaches to improve upon existing deep generative models, and in its application to semi-supervised learning.

If you are interested in knowing more about what Iâ€™ve worked on, please see my CV.
